### About Me

I am a front-end web developer currently open for a new job. I live in Orlando but would work remotely or consider relocating.

I focus on JavaScript, and have worked with frameworks such as ReactJS and VueJS before. During social distancing efforts 
I have spent more time focusing on the very basics of Android applications as well as creating projects utilizing JavaScript.

My background is in SEO and social media work with some WordPress development thrown in. I loved being able to talk to clients and learn about
their companies and play to their strengths in order to increase their sales. During this time I learned more about WordPress, keyword research and Google Analytics.

### Future Projects

I am currently recreating my portfolio site as I am no longer happy with the design of my current one.

I am planning a web application that helps decide what your next read (or batch of reads) should be. I eventually plan to make this into an app using React Native as well.
I have been an active participant in the online book community for years and I know picking the next read is one of the most difficult choices sometimes.

You can always support me and my projects by donating [here](https://ko-fi.com/jkimexploring).

#### I hope you have a wonderful day!
